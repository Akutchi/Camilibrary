# The Camilibrary project

This project is a website that will be able to show every book that I ever read
on the subject of gender studies and related fields.

This Project is developped using Django as I wanted to learn this framework for
quite a while now. Moreover, I'm using [cotton](https://django-cotton.com/) to
bring component-based design to django.
